## Property Management Portal

Property management portal is a web-based java project where house owners and customers can exchange information effectively and inexpensively. This system provides a user-friendly interface, satisfying the needs of the consumers.

There are three roles in this system- Landlord, Admin, and Tenant.

- The landlord is the user who owns the house and wants it to give it for rent. The landlord will upload all the details of the house, including the number of rooms, locality, rent.
- Admin manages all the users of the system.
- Tenant is the one who is looking for a rental house. She/He can search the house according to the requirements and get the results accordingly.

Dashboard Page for admins:

- Display the last 10 properties rented.
- Display 10 most recent tenants.
- Display total income per location.
- Add more features as you see fit.

Dashboard Page for landlords:
